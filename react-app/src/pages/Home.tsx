                📝 Create a full stack application, leveraging the Giphy API.
                This API gives you instant access to a library with millions of
                gifs. The application is expected to support the following
                features:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        GIFs Listing and Filtering: users are expected to
                        retrieve, search, and filter GIFs based on typed text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GIF Upload: allow users to upload GIFs to the
                        application, providing metadata you consider valuable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Persistence: Ensure uploaded GIFs are stored
                        persistently. We recommend using a free cloud storage
                        service for this purpose.
